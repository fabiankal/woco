And even change the code within an online R studio environment: https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/fabiankal/woco/master?urlpath=rstudio

The package includes:
1) *descriptives.Rmd*: for creating aggregated data of time-trends from micro data provided @AUSSDA [previous recoding to long required]
2) *flexdashboard.Rmd*: for creating the R-shiny app
3) several data files of aggregated data produced by the package or published online here XX
