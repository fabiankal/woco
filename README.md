# WoCo
Work and Corona (WoCo) dashboard for plotting data from the Austrian Panel Project (ACPP) and the WoCo project over time.

This is the R code package for replicating the dashboard provided @ https://woco.univie.ac.at/dashboard

You can also access the dashboard via binder: [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/fabiankal/woco/master?urlpath=shiny)

And even change the code within an online R studio environment: https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/fabiankal/woco/master?urlpath=rstudio

The package includes:
1) *descriptives.Rmd*: for creating aggregated data of time-trends from micro data provided @AUSSDA [previous recoding to long required]
2) *flexdashboard.Rmd*: for creating the R-shiny app
3) several data files of aggregated data produced by the package. 

The ACPP micro dataset can be accessed here: Kittel, Bernhard; Kritzinger, Sylvia; Boomgaarden, Hajo; Prainsack, Barbara; Eberl, Jakob-Moritz; Kalleitner, Fabian; Lebernegg, Noëlle S.; Partheymüller, Julia; Plescia, Carolina; Schiestl, David W.; Schlogl, Lukas, 2020, "Austrian Corona Panel Project (SUF edition)", https://doi.org/10.11587/28KQNS, AUSSDA, V4.
